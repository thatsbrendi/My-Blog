                    <p>Europe is a continent located entirely in the Northern Hemisphere and mostly in the Eastern
                        Hemisphere. It is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, the
                        Mediterranean Sea to the south, and Asia to the east. Europe shares the landmass of Eurasia with
                        Asia, and of Afro-Eurasia with both Asia and Africa. Europe is commonly considered to be
                        separated from Asia by the watershed of the Ural Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian Sea, the
                        Greater Caucasus, the Black Sea, and the waterway of the Bosporus Strait. <br>
                        Europe covers about 10.18 million km2 (3.93 million sq mi), or 2% of Earth's surface (6.8% of
                        land area), making it the second-smallest continent (using the seven-continent model).
                        Politically, Europe is divided into about fifty sovereign states, of which Russia is the largest
                        and most populous, spanning 39% of the continent and comprising 15% of its population.</p>

                    <p>European culture consists of a range of national and regional cultures, which form the central
                        roots of the wider Western civilisation, and together commonly reference ancient Greece and
                        ancient Rome, particularly through their Christian successors, as crucial and shared
                        roots. Beginning with the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 CE, Christian
                        consolidation of Europe in the wake of the Migration Period marked the European post-classical
                        Middle Ages. The Italian Renaissance, radiating from Florence, spread to the rest of the
                        continent a new humanist interest in art and science which led to the modern era. Since the Age
                        of Discovery, led by Spain and Portugal, Europe played a predominant role in global affairs with
                        multiple explorations and conquests around the world. Between the 16th and 20th centuries,
                        European powers colonised at various times the Americas, almost all of Africa and Oceania, and
                        the majority of Asia.
                        <br>
                        The Age of Enlightenment, the French Revolution, and the Napoleonic Wars shaped the continent
                        culturally, politically and economically from the end of the 17th century until the first half
                        of the 19th century. The Industrial Revolution, which began in Great Britain at the end of the
                        18th century, gave rise to radical economic, cultural and social change in Western Europe and
                        eventually the wider world. Both world wars began and were fought to a great extent in Europe,
                        contributing to a decline in Western European dominance in world affairs by the mid-20th century
                        as the Soviet Union and the United States took prominence and competed over dominance in Europe
                        and globally. The resulting Cold War divided Europe along the Iron Curtain, with NATO in the
                        West and the Warsaw Pact in the East.

                    <p>European integration is being advanced institutionally since 1948 with the founding of the
                        Council of Europe, and significantly through the realisation of the European Union (EU), which
                        represents today the majority of Europe. The European Union is a supranational political
                        entity that lies between a confederation and a federation and is based on a system of European
                        treaties. The EU originated in Western Europe but has been expanding eastward since the
                        dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991.</p>
